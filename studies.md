# Studies

These initial studies are test cases for the design of the Deliberation Lab experimental platform. Data from each of these studies contributes to the individual research questions of their PIs, and also supports the development of a fully-documented, traceable, and mutually-commensurable community dataset.

#### Can good listening be taught (quickly)?

Mastering the skill of listening can take a lifetime and can be the subject of intensive, multi-day training sessions. However, there are situations where a temporary enhancement in an individual's listening ability can profoundly impact the outcomes of subsequent conversations or negotiations.

This research collaboration between [Netta Weinstein](https://www.reading.ac.uk/pcls/staff/netta-weinstein) at the University of Reading and the [Computational Social Science Lab](https://css.seas.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania explores the effectiveness of short, video-format training for improving listening behaviors during one-on-one discussions. The study aims to evaluate practical tools that lead conversation participants to feel respected and heard, and which facilitate meaningful dialogue that improves understanding, empathy, and collaboration among individuals with diverse perspectives.

#### Is the leader a bad influence?

![Leader](/assets/img/leader_1.jpg){: width="300" style="float: right; padding-left:10px"}

In small group discussions, the opinion of a leader often has an outsized influence on the decisions made by a group and the subsequent belief updating of participants in response to the discussion. This can lead to the detriment of group performance as information held by other parties is suppressed, and other expertise is not taken into account. However, in observational studies of real world groups, it is difficult to distinguish whether this influence comes from an individual's status as a leader, or from the interpersonal skills or biases that lead them to be given leadership in the first place, making the remedy for this issue uncertain.

This collaboration between researchers at [Princeton University](https://willschulz.com/), [Washington University in St Louis](http://christopherlucas.org/), [the Wharton School](https://oid.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/dcknox/) and the [Computational Social Science Lab](https://css.seas.upenn.edu/) disentangles the influence of status that comes from being assigned a leadership role from individual characteristics. By exploring the effects of assigning a leader on factors such as influence, talk time distribution, and overall group dynamics, this study aims to shed light on the role of leadership in shaping deliberative outcomes. The findings from this study will enhance our understanding of how leadership dynamics impact group discussions and provide valuable insights for designing more effective and inclusive deliberative processes.

#### Am I talking too much?

![Rock scale](/assets/img/balanced_rocks_1.png){: width="300" style="float: left; padding-right:10px"}

Gender and age differences play a significant role in shaping status imbalances and unequal participation in conversations, leading to perceptions of unfair treatment. Stereotypical labels such as "uppity youngsters," "chatty Cathys," and "old gasbags" are often used to describe individuals who deviate from the expected norms of talk time balance. Moreover, phenomena like "mansplaining" highlight the negative behaviors that stem from gender differences. To address these issues, various interventions have been developed to promote balanced participation, ensuring that every participant has an equal opportunity to contribute and be heard. These interventions encompass training programs, live feedback mechanisms, and structured discussion formats. However, the effectiveness of these interventions is likely to be influenced by the specific behavioral patterns observed in a given context.

This project from the [Computational Social Science Lab](https://css.seas.upenn.edu/) explores the interactions between age, gender, and conversation dynamics. The study measures the actual balance of talk time in conversations and assesses the perception of individuals speaking "too much" or "not enough." By considering a range of age and gender combinations, this study first creates a baseline map of the systematic variations in baseline behavior. The project then evaluates the effectiveness of different interventions in cultivating an environment that encourages the active participation of every individual.
