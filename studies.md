These initial studies served as test cases for the design of the Deliberation Lab experimental platform. Data from each of these studies contributes to the individual research questions of their PIs, and also supports the development of a fully-documented, traceable, and mutually-commensurable community dataset.

A collaboration betweeen the University of Reading's [Netta Weinstein](https://www.reading.ac.uk/pcls/staff/netta-weinstein) and the Computational Social Science Lab's [James Houghton](https://www.jamesphoughton.com/), this study investigates the potential for short-format training to improve listening behaviors in one-on-one discussions. This research aims to uncover practical tools that can be used in contexts where a supportive and engaging environment can lead to more meaningful dialogue, fostering better understanding, empathy, and collaboration among people with diverse perspectives.

The collaborative study led by Dean Knox's team at the University of Pennsylvania is focused on investigating the influence of assigning an individual as a group leader in small-group deliberations. This research project delves into the dynamics of persuasion and decision-making within groups. By exploring the effects of assigning a leader on factors such as influence, talk time distribution, and overall group dynamics, this study aims to shed light on the role of leadership in shaping deliberative outcomes. The findings from this study will enhance our understanding of how leadership dynamics impact group discussions and provide valuable insights for designing more effective and inclusive deliberative processes. This collaboration with Dean Knox's team enriches our research by bringing diverse perspectives and expertise, fostering a multidimensional understanding of the complex dynamics at play in small-group deliberation.

Led by James Houghton and Duncan Watts at the Computational Social Science Lab, this study evaluates interventions for promoting balanced participation within small-group deliberations, such that each participant has an equal opportunity to contribute and be heard. By implementing various training, feedback, and discussion structuring interventions, we aim to foster an atmosphere that values and encourages the active participation of every individual. The study explores the effect that age and gender diversity have on baseline participation rates, and how these factors influence the effectiveness of different participation interventions.
