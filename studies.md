# Studies

These initial studies are test cases for the design of the Deliberation Lab experimental platform. Data from each of these studies contributes to the individual research questions of their PIs, and also supports the development of a fully-documented, traceable, and mutually-commensurable community dataset.

#### Can good listening be taught (quickly)?

Mastering the skill of listening can take a lifetime and can be the subject of intensive, multi-day training sessions. However, there are situations where a temporary enhancement in an individual's listening ability can profoundly impact the outcomes of subsequent conversations or negotiations.

This research collaboration between [Netta Weinstein](https://www.reading.ac.uk/pcls/staff/netta-weinstein) at the University of Reading and the [Computational Social Science Lab](https://css.seas.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania explores the effectiveness of short, video-format training for improving listening behaviors during one-on-one discussions. The study aims to evaluate practical tools that lead conversation participants to feel respected and heard, and which facilitate meaningful dialogue that improves understanding, empathy, and collaboration among individuals with diverse perspectives.

#### Is the leader a bad influence?

![Leader](/assets/img/leader_1.jpg){: width="300" style="float: right; padding-left:10px"}

In small group discussions, the opinions of leaders often carry significant weight, shaping group decisions and influencing the beliefs of subordinates. This disproportionate influence can hinder group performance by suppressing valuable information held by other group members or by limiting the consideration of all available options. Unfortunately, in observational studies of real-world groups, it is difficult to distinguish whether this influence stems from an individual's status as a leader or from the factors that contributed to their selection as a leader in the first place, such as their individual skills or social position.

To address this challenge, researchers from [Princeton University](https://willschulz.com/), [Washington University in St Louis](http://christopherlucas.org/), [the Wharton School](https://oid.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/dcknox/) and the [Computational Social Science Lab](https://css.seas.upenn.edu/) are collaborating to disentangle the influence of assigned leadership status from the influence of the individual characteristics of leaders themselves.
By investigating the effects of leadership assignments on various factors such as influence, distribution of talk time, and overall group dynamics, this study aims to provide insights into the role of leadership in shaping the outcomes of deliberations.

#### Am I talking too much?

![Rock scale](/assets/img/balanced_rocks_1.png){: width="300" style="float: left; padding-right:10px"}

Gender and age differences play a significant role in shaping status imbalances and unequal participation in conversations, leading to perceptions of unfair treatment. Stereotypical labels such as "uppity youngsters," "chatty Cathys," and "old gasbags" are often used to describe individuals who deviate from the expected norms of talk time balance. Moreover, phenomena like "mansplaining" highlight the negative behaviors that stem from gender differences. To address these issues, various interventions have been developed to promote balanced participation, ensuring that every participant has an equal opportunity to contribute and be heard. These interventions encompass training programs, live feedback mechanisms, and structured discussion formats. However, the effectiveness of these interventions is likely to be influenced by the specific behavioral patterns observed in a given context.

This project from the [Computational Social Science Lab](https://css.seas.upenn.edu/) explores the interactions between age, gender, and conversation dynamics. The study measures the actual balance of talk time in conversations and assesses the perception of individuals speaking "too much" or "not enough." By considering a range of age and gender combinations, this study first creates a baseline map of the systematic variations in baseline behavior. The project then evaluates the effectiveness of different interventions in cultivating an environment that encourages the active participation of every individual.
