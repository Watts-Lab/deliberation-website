In a deliberative landscape where

Why this might be true:

- Deliberation is diverse, many factors influence the outcomes of deliberation, so there are many different types of deliberation and many factors to consider when deciding how to hold a deliberation. While we can have heuristics that are generally applicable, it may be that
- collective trial and error is slow, and doesn't contextualize well - ie, we can

To do this we have a new approach to conducting research

20-50 groups total, the virtual laboratory can collect samples from this many groups in a single# Deliberation Lab

The deliberation lab is a project of the Computational Social Science Lab at the University of Pennsylvania. The project's goal is to understand the diversity of d

## A high-throughput virtual laboratory

The core technology developed to support this project is an online laboratory for conducting small-group deliberation experiments at scale. The virtual laboratory handles much of the overhead work that would normally require human facilitation, for example:

- Recruiting participants and recording consent
- Measuring baseline characteristics such as sociodemographic or psychometric attributes that can be used to characterize the participants in a given discussion.
- Assigning participants to groups to create a desired demographic composition within each group
- Delivering interventions
- Coordinating one or more video-call discussions between participants
- Conducting post-discussion surveys

By removing the need for human facilitators, we can dramatically increase the number of deliberation exercises that a research team can include in a given study. Whereas many published studies consider sample sizes on the order of afternoon, completely unsupervised.

Under active development are interventions that monitor a discussion and use live feedback to help participants share time and surface opinions of less active members. The first of these will be a visual dial to show the amount of time teh participant has spent talking, encouraging equitable participation and discouraging dominance by certain individuals. Followon interventions may include reflections of sentiment or other behaviors.

Also under development are tools that allow participants to collaborate on a shared work product, such as a canvas for co-writing a group response to a particular discussion topic.
