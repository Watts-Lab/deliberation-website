The Deliberation Lab is an open-science intiative to rapidly advance scientific understanding of small group deliberation. It's goal is to support groups that come together to learn from one another, build mutual respect, and solve their collective problems.

To achieve this goal, the initiative is developing a set of tools for conducting deliberation experiments at scale, and coordinating a community of researchers to work together to build a cumulative understanding of deliberation outcomes.

### Our Approach

There is no one-size-fits-all strategy for improving the outcomes of small-group deliberation. Instead, the best techniques for achieving a deliberation's objective depend on the nature of the group (e.g. its size, gender balance, age range, etc.), the nature of the topic (e.g. its technicality, urgency, or moral character), and its purpose (e.g. to make a decision, raise issues, learn from one another, etc.).

As a result, our approach emphasizes the context-dependence of a measured result, and seeks to map a landscape of deliberation features to show how differerent styles of intervention behave under different conditions. With this approach, we aim to provide contextualized recommendations to real-world deliberative groups that take their composition, topic, and task into account.

### Our Community

The space of all possible deliberation experiments is far too large to explore alone. Instead, we hope to assemble a community of researchers to collaboratively study a variety of deliberative contexts and intervention strategies. Working together, these researchers will assemble a mutually-commensurable dataset that will advance the field of deliberation research.

The initiative is led by the [Computational Social Science Lab](https://css.seas.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/).
